Cambridge Task Four
Inside you will find 3 folderst that feature many of the main points of Object Orientated Programming.

In Class Modifiers:
	A main driver code that runs through final, abstract, protected, static and public.
	The code will initially error as the final overrides are still uncommented.

In ExamplesOfOOP:
	Code that runs through inheritance to demonstrate OOP.

In Polymorphism:
	This folder has two sub folders: static and dynamic.
		Static:
			In this form of polymorphism there can be multiple versions of a method with the same name that are distinguished based upon the numbers of paramters they take.
			The compiler looks at the method signature and decides which method to invoke for a particular method call at compile time.
		
		Dynamic:
			In this form of polymorphism a subclass can override an attribute or value of its parent class (method overriding).
			Java does this at runtime and it is also called dynamic binding or late binding.
