Cambridge Task Four
Inside you will find 3 folders that give examples of the main building blocks of OOP, with a greater focus on polymorphism and inheritance.

In Class Modifiers:
	A main driver code that runs through final, abstract, protected, static and public.
	The code will initially error as the final overrides are still uncommented.

In ExamplesOfOOP:
	Contains an example of inheritance in Java.

In Polymorphism:
	This folder has two sub folders: static and dynamic.
		Static:
			In this form of polymorphism there can be multiple versions of a method with the same name that are distinguished based upon the numbers of paramters they take.
			The compiler looks at the method signature and decides which method to invoke for a particular method call at compile time.
		
		Dynamic:
			In this form of polymorphism a subclass can override an attribute or value of its parent class (method overriding).
			Java does this at runtime and it is also called dynamic binding or late binding.
	
	Each folder contains simple Java code to demonstrate both of these forms of polymorphism.
